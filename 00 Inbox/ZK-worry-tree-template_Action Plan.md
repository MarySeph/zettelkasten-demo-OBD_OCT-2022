# Worry Tree Template: Action Plan
---

topic:: [[#]]

Depends on the kind of worry it is. Decide if it's something that can be resolved or something there is little control over. If it can be resolved, write an action plan to do so. If it can't be controlled, acknowledge this on paper and choose a distraction from the list. Remember, choosing a distraction is making an action plan. Deciding to ignore what causes a worry is taking control over those thoughts.
