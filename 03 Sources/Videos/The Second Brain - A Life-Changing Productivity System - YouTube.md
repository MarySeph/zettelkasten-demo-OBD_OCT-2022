Personal Knowledge Management (2nd brain)

-   digital note-taking system
-   everything that resonates
-   organize thoughts, ideas and convert to creative output

Principles:

1.  Borrowed Creativity
    
    > Creativity is all about remixing stuff
    
    <aside> 💡 Good artists copy, great artists, steal. — Picasso
    
    </aside>
    
2.  The Capture Habit
    
    -   brains arent for storing ideas
    -   that's where the 2nd brain comes in
3.  Idea Recycling
    
    -   Keep tracks of things we are creating and all ideas that made it possible
    -   because those same ideas can be used for something else
4.  Projects Over Categories
    
    -   associate notes and ideas to projects
5.  Slow Burns
    
    -   Heavy lifts vs Slow Burn
        -   Projects are being worked on slowly instead of all at once
6.  Start with Abundance
    
    -   Dont start from a blank page
    -   If you have collected notes already, you won't start from zero
7.  Intermediate Packets
    
    -   parts of a whole that can be reused
    
    > i.e. essay paragraphs, each item in this video
    
8.  You Only Know What You Make
    
    -   Of all the stuff you consume, you remember what you create with it
        -   Even creating a note helps remembering content
        -   Engage with the content
9.  Make it Easier For Your Future Self
    
    -   Create a resource now for your future self
    -   Write notes for your future self
    -   Assume notes is for someone who doesn't know
10.  Keep your Ideas Moving    
	-   Anti-perfectionism

	-   Can improve system over time
