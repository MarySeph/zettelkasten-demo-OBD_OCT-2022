# DRAFT HSP Care Kit_ Making a Personal Info Guide
topic:: [[Mental Health]]

---

Sensitivity is a trait that has many takes in the Western world. It's also represented in many different ways: a person who cries easily, someone who is good at taking care of others, a good listener, an empathetic person, etc. These representations are linked together by the term "highly sensitive person" or HSP, coined by [[Elaine Aron]]. She noticed similar traits between people, but this "sensitivity" was related to a mental illness or gender. From her research, she described highly sensitive people have four common traits, or DOES as explained by psychologist Kati Morton:

- D - Depth of Processing. Highly sensitive people look into things more deeply. For example, seek alone time to process how something would affect other.
- O - Over Stimulation. From the outside, this overlaps with shyness and sensory processing disorder. Highly sensitive people tend to overload with information and may avoid strong smells, noises, and/or fabrics.
- E - Emotional Reactivity and Empathy. Highly sensitive people can read the vibe of a room and a person. This is not the same as being an empath because HSPs are about sensory information. While empathy and high sensitivity are not mutually inclusive, HSPs may also be empaths. Highly sensitive people can take on other people's moods and tend do try to make them feel better. HSPs also hate conflict and it can make them feel very tired.
- S - Sensing the Subtle. Highly sensitive people noticing subtle changes like facial expressions.

Additionally, highly sensitive people may have been told they were too sensitive, have trouble sleeping, difficulty dealing with change, and internalize negative emotions. This is because of the first trait, by absorbing a lot of sensory data, the brain needs much more time to process it.

As someone who identifies as a highly sensitive person, I was interested in self-care advice by other HSPs. Simple Happy Zen has a video series called "Healthy Habits for Highly Sensitive People." I filtered their advice that spoke to a personal level and developed a self-care guide. I reflected on the attitudes I tended to take towards what the world put in front of me and the things that make me happy. This guide is divided in five sections: listing triggers, things that brightened my mood, how to watch out my thoughts, positive habits to add to my morning and night routines, exercice, and action plan.
