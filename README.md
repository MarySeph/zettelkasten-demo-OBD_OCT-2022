# README

This demo was made for Obsidian October, or O_O for short. Based on Zettelkasten principles, it also focuses on combining information towards and output. Thus, this demo is reccomended for fiction and non-fiction writers who use the Zettelkasten method to create their outputs.

## Instructions 

This demo is divided into two section: Zettelkasten and Content Creation.

### Section 1: Zettelkasten

1. When you find an article or video that you want to create notes on, create a note in Obsidian (either with the icon or using Cmd/Ctrl+O) with the title of the source. Then, add [[Template, Reference üìñ]] with slash command, or insert template button (mobile only).
	- In #source/ specify the type of source (article, video, PDF, etc).
	- Write the name of the author after `author::`
	- Then, go to [[COLLECT & PROCESS]] and check the source you just created appears under [[COLLECT & PROCESS#COLLECT]].
	- Move the note to 03 Sources, and a more specific folder for the source type if so desire.
2. Consume the source with the method of your preference.
	- Store screenshots and related files in 02 Files.
	- Change the play emoji (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) after `lifestyle::` metadata to the checkmark emoji (‚úÖ). The source will now appear under [[COLLECT & PROCESS#PROCESS]] instead of [[COLLECT & PROCESS#COLLECT]].
3.  Next, slipt the screen vertically or horizontally. One side will have the source and the other where you'll create zettels.
4. Create zettels with the method of your preference. [[Templates, Zettel üè∑Ô∏è]] is at your service.
	- tag, date, and UID will be created automatically.
	- Link back to the source on `source::`
	- Link related notes after `see also::`
	- When you're done, change the play button emoji (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) after `zettel status::` metadata to checkmark emoji (‚úÖ). The source will dissappear from [[COLLECT & PROCESS]] but you can find them in [[Sources MOC]] without using the side panel.

### Section 2: Content Creation 
The following templates are at your disposal to write articles and papers:
- [[Template, DRAFT Blog Post]]
- [[Template, Blog Post Worksheet]]
- [[Template, Blog Post Brainstorm]]
- [[Template, Research Topic]]
- [[Template, Research Outline]]

I leave you with some recommendations on how to organize your outputs:

All notes created from the aforementioned templates go in 05 Efforts. 
- The folder "05.01 In-progress" is for the long form content you're currently working on (articles, chapters, etc).
- Meanwhile, "05.02 Metatext" is for pre-writing notes derived from [[Template, Blog Post Brainstorm]] and [[Template, Blog Post Worksheet]]. 
- Lastly, "05.04 Archives" is where completed longform efforts are stored.

> If you're a fiction writer, I recommend reading [Vanessa Glau's article on writing fiction in Obsidian](https://write.as/vanessaglau/how-i-plan-and-write-fiction-in-obsidian) for more tips.
